## Introduction

> ***Note:*** _This should be done independently._

This assignment will test your understanding of creating test cases and user stories. You will choose your favorite app, and write at least three test cases to evaluate its features. There should be at least six conditionals per test case. Additionally, you will be writing user stories for each conditional.

## Exercise

#### Requirements

- Select an app you use (e.g. Facebook)
- Choose three features of the app to write test cases for
- Create six conditionals per test case - all of the conditions must be true in order for the feature to be considered "implemented" (see the example in the [lesson](https://github.com/ga-adi-nyc/Course-Materials/tree/master/lessons/testing/testing-intro-lesson))
- Create user stories for each conditional

**Bonus:**
- Add more test cases and conditionals

#### Deliverable

Submit a pull request to this assignment with your test cases in a document or spreadsheet. You can put them in a simple .txt file if you like. If you make a spreadsheet in Google Sheets you can just provide a link rather than download and re-upload it.
